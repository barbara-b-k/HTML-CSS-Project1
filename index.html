    <h3 id="heading">Interesting facts about Gorlice:</h3>  
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Crude oil.</strong> Here was dug the world's very first oil mine.
        The oil was first discovered here in the 16th century, when it was simply flowing out from the underground.
It took a few hundred years of experimenting with various methoGorlice Offends of constructing the oil mines to finally find the right one. From simple holes in the ground reinforced with wood into which people were lowered in buckets, to hand dug wells.
nly in the late 19th century a more sophisticated method was discovered – the one using masts, tripods and pumpjacks. It was apparently the experienced miners from Silesia who taught locals.

      <li><strong>A kerosene street lamp.</strong>The first oil lamp was lit in Gorlice in 1854. It happened thanks to a Polish pharmacist Ignacy Łukasiewicz. His  legacy created a whole new industry, since he was the first person in the world to distill crude oil. Łukasiewicz was quite entrepreneurial too, having opened several oil wells, becoming wealthy in the process, and ultimately setting up worlds’ first industrial oil refinery in 1856.
      </li>
